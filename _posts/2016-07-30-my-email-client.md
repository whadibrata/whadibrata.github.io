There is no denying that email has been part of my life, even more so, I use it far more frequently than SMS (I assume so). Indeed, it has been part of everyone's life in this millennia. It is, therefore, unnecessary to explain why it is important. The question is then, which email client should I use for managing my mails ?

My two primary choices for email client on my phone are [Inbox][c4336ad8]  and [Gmail][b9b3ebc9]. Perhaps, since I am using Gmail as my email service provider, it is, therefore, natural for me to go for Gmail as my main app. The ability to automatically categorize the incoming mails have been my main reason for using it. It helps you prioritize which mails to be read now or later. I used the app all the time before Google announce Inbox, an alternative to Gmail. At first, it was rather odd for Google to announce Inbox considering that they were still maintaining Gmail. I was so excited for Inbox because of the snooze feature they included. In fact, I was so excited at the time that I opted to be a limited beta user. Inbox was very limited in that it required you to have an invitation before you can use the app. I still remember I had to wait a couple of weeks until I got one. Ever since I got the invitation, I don't think I have stopped using it and I have to say I love Inbox.

Things are quite different in the case of PC email clients. I never considered using separate email client on my PC as an option. I had always used web browser to access my mails. Later I realized, not only that it was inconvenient, it was also very ineffective. You had to open a web browser, type in the web address and check for new emails. This would repeat every time I needed to read an email. To get push notification, you have to leave the webpage open all the time and activate it within the browser. It was so much of a hassle. I knew that there was Microsoft Outlook that would do the job for me. But frankly, I did not like it for its non-intuitive user interfaces and "too complicated" features. I used it for a couple of days but decided not to continue using it afterward.

Finally, the day has come where [Nylas][90d9bcad] announced that it would release an open source email client dubbed as Nylas N1. Just like Inbox, it was only available for beta users. After reviewing its feature, I immediately got hooked on it. Without hesitation, I opted to be beta users. It has been months that I started using it and I never look for an alternative. It was only last month that Nylas finalized beta version and released a stable version. Unfortunately, along with the release of its stable version, Nylas also announced a new pricing scheme for the app. You can no longer use the app for free unless you build the app and set you own server. The good news for beta users was that they provided one year free subscription. So I considered myself lucky. Although I would still have paid for it had it not been free at all. All the features of the app are worth the pennies.

**Conclusion**
