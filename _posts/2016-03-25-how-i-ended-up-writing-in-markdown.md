# How I ended up writing my notes in markdown (Draft)
Back in the "past", I used to keep and write my notes with apps like Evernote, Google Keep, and many others. I kept changing back and forth between one note taking app to another. It was mainly because one particular app does not have a feature(s) that the other app does.  For instance, we can only write simple text in Google Keep unlike in Evernote where you can add lists, tables, checkbox, etc. I also fall into the category of someone who does care about the look of the app and I tend to spend more time with an app that looks gorgeous. Evernote is, for instance, looking more beautiful than Google Keep which is why I use Evernote more than others.

For awhile I settled down with Evernote as it gave me almost all the things that I needed. A note taking app that does not have only basic feature of note writing. One great thing about Evernote is that it is available in many platforms. You have a native apps in Windows, OS X, iOS and Android as well as online Evernote. What this basically means is that you can write a note wherever and whenever you need to. It is most convenient at a time when I need to take down a note on a random occasion. I just need to pull out my phone and write everything that comes to mind

Everything took a big turn when I learned [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). It is basically just a much simpler way of writing html. Instead of wrapping everything within an html tag, you just add a symbol in front of anything you want to write. One of the simplest example will be writing a block quote. In a plain html, to have a passage inside a block quote, you have to write like following:

```
<blockquote>A quote will come here</blockquote>
```

In markdown, all you have to do is to put a bigger than sign in front of the quote, like so:


```
> A quote will come here
```

The end result of both will be the same. And it looks like this

> A quote will come here

Of course, there is also an issue of rendering the markdown to html behind all these. But the point here is, you can write almost anything that is possible when you write an html file. Things like different heading size, a table, a quote, a codeblock, etc. These will come in handy while writing anything starting from a simple note to a blog post.

To be continued ...
