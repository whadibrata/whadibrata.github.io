Finally, after weeks of going back and forth between designing and coding I can safely say that I am almost done with my own personal website. I really had a lot of fun learning hmtl, css and javascript. I started designing this website as part of a new hobby that I recently took up. At first I never intended to take it serious but as I kept doing it, I found a lot of fun in it. Mostly, the fun part comes from that moment when you are trying hard to find out what is wrong with the code. I often spend hours just to find out that I had placed a wrong attributes of css. But in the end, when I finally solve the problem, that feeling of accomplishment is priceless.

Keep in mind that this is my "real" first website that I started from scratch with only text editor and browser. Therefore, there might be missing things, bugs and issues here and there. I am hoping that I will have time to maintain this site and possibly make changes later on.

I chose github for my hosting because of one thing. It is FREE. Github also comes with [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com "jekyll") server as a plus. Since this website is built on top of jekyll, I do not have to worry again about server related issues as github automatically builds the site for me. Hosting on github also means another thing. All the codes I have written for this website is open for all. Anyone can fork, download and modify the codes as they like. You can find the sources at [github](http://github.com/whadibrata "sources").
